= Liquid Crystal Library for ARM STM32 =

This library allows a STM32 ARM microcontroller to control LiquidCrystal displays (LCDs) based on the Hitachi HD44780 (or a compatible) chipset, which is found on most text-based LCDs.
This is a port of LiquidCrystal library from Arduino.

== This library currently supports the following functionalities ==

TIP: *The examples have been built for the STM32F3 Discovery, but the library should work on any STM32 ARM microcontroller.*

NOTE: *This library and its examples are originated from
http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal*
